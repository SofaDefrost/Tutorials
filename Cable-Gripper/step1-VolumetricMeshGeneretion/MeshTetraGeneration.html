        	<h1>Step 1: Volumetric mesh generation</h1>
		
        <p>
	In order to simulate a mechanical object using Finite Element Modeling (FEM), a discrete version of its volume is required. 
	This volume, referred as volumetric mesh will serve as a domain for FEM computation. The aim of this tutorial step is to explain how to create such a volumetric mesh from a 
	closed surface description made of triangles. </p>

	<p>Several tools exist for volume meshing such as GID (http://www.gidhome.com/), CGAL (http://www.cgal.org/) or Gmsh (http://geuz.org/gmsh/). 
	In the following, we will use CGAL, as a dedicated plugin is available within the SOFA framework.</p>
