        	<h1>Step 4: Direct manipulation of the fingertip position. </h1>
		<p>In the previous steps, we showed how to model and simulate a soft robot with a finger shape and made of a deformable material (silicone). 
		We also explained how to add a cable to this model to actuate it, and how to add an interactive script to simulate pulling on this cable. 
		Deforming a soft robot in such a way can be considered as an indirect way to control the fingertip position. Indirect because to change the 
		fingertip position ones need to pull the cable as a puppeteer. In this step, we will see how to add a direct control of the fingertip position. </p>

	        <h2>How to use the demo</h2>
		<p> After clicking on "Animate" you can select the orange sphere (shift + click left) and move it around. 
		The effector, represented with a green square at the fingertip, will follow at best the sphere by acting on the cable.</p>
