	<h1>Step 7: Grasping Simulation</h1>
	<p>The simulation in SOFA allows to reproduce grasping using a combination of constraints for frictional contact (using Coulomb's friction) and for actuators. 
	To do this, we need to modify several elements of the simulation (see SoftGripper_directControl.pyscn).
        </p>
        
        
        <br>
        <h2> A. Activate collision and direct simulation </h2>
        <p> In this exemple, we will simulate the collision response of the gripper with its environment and particularly an object that will be grasped. 
        The first step is to activate the modules for collision detection and response in SOFA. This modules are described in more details in the documentation of SOFA. 
        The user can modify the coefficient of friction in RuleBasedContactManager (mu=0.8). GenericConstraintSolver is able to solve, in a unified system, the constraints 
        for collision response and the constraints (direct, non inverse) of the actuators. 
        </p>
        
        
        <br>
        <h2> B. Add an object that will be grasped </h2>
        
        <center>
            <img src="./images/image1.png"/>
        </center>
        
        <p> We add a rigid object, and simulate its dynamics with a 6Dof mechanical object. It computes the physics at the center of gravity. 
        The mass and inertia of the object are computed by UniformMass. The component UncoupledConstraintCorrection provides the physics-based response after collision 
        (in practice, it will use the parameters of the component UniformMass).
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p> Then, we will need to add a collision model to detect the contact between this cube and the soft gripper. 
        First, we load the mesh that is used for collision and create a mechanical object with it. 
        Then, we add the collision primitive (Triangle, Line and Point) that will be tested. Finally, the collision model is 
        linked to the behavior of the center of gravity by a RigidMapping.</p>
        <br>

        </center>
        
        <p> In the same way, we can load an other mesh and use a mapping for the visualization.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2> C. Add a fixed floor </h2>
        
        <p> Now, we add a collision surface collision plane so that we can place the object before and after grasping:

        <h2> D. Add collision models to the gripper </h2>
        
        <center><img src="./images/image3.png"/></center>

        <p> We need to put a collision surface to each finger of the soft gripper. In the graph, the collision model is a child of the node that contains the mechanical object 
        (here, the FEM model of each finger). This surface is defined by a mesh (here finger.stl). The primitive of collision are also defined (Triangle, Line, Point). 
        The surface motion is linked to the motion of the FEM model using a BarycentricMapping:

        <h2> E. Control the gripper </h2>
        
        <center><img src="./images/image31.png"/></center>
        
        
	<p>
        The user can interactively control the gripper using keyboard events. The definition of the controls is done using a python script
       
        
        To close/open the gripper, press the following keys:
		<ul> 
				<li><b> ctrl + </b></li>
				<li><b> ctrl - </b></li>
		</ul>
        Note that with MacOS, you may have to use <b> cmd </b> instead of <b> ctrl </b>. The actuator are controlled in force. They key <b> ctrl + </b> increased the force applied on the cable.
        
        To move the gripper, press the following keys:
        <ul>
            <li><b> ctrl &#8593; </b> to move it up </li>
            <li><b> ctrl &#8595;</b> to move it down</li>
            <li><b> ctrl &#8592; </b> to move it left </li>
            <li><b> ctrl &#8594;</b> to move it right</li>
            
        </ul>
