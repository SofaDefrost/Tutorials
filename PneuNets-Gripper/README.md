Modeling and simulating PneuNets with Sofa-SR
=======================


#### Introduction
This tutorial is about modeling, simulating and fabricating a soft gripper made with PneuNets actuators. 

PneuNets (pneumatic networks) are a class of soft actuator originally developed by the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard. They are made up of a series of channels and chambers inside an elastomer. These channels inflate when pressurized, creating 
motion.

Sofa-SR is a modeling, simulation and control environment for Soft-Robotics using Sofa a real-time simulation framework for rigid and deformable mechanics. Sofa-SR is available from https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/

This tutorials is freely adapted from  https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneunets-bending-actuator, the big difference is on how to use the Sofa+Soft-Robot for modeling and simulation and control. 


#### Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial you need a working version of Sofa. We provide a Linux disk image with a pre-compiled version of Sofa with all the material for this tutorials. 

Otherwise you need to get sofa & its soft-robotic toolkit plugin:
- Sofa (from http://www.sofa-framework.org)
- Soft-Robotic Toolkit plugin (from https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/)
