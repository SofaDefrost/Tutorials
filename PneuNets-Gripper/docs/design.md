Design
=======================


#### PneuNets actuator
Very detailled description of the PneuNets actuators can be found at the Soft robotics Toolkit pages: https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneunets-bending-actuator

We followed their approached but wanted to try the laster cutting system. We used Inkscape to draw the different parts we need. ![Sketches in SVG](../images/mold_all_sketches.png)

#### Mounting plateform 
The mounting plateform is holding the three PneuNets actuators on a structure of triangular shape. The structure should also be used to hold the different pipes and air distribution system as well as a way to connect the gripper to a real 3-DOF robotic arm. 

#### Pressuring system & motor plateform.
The pressure system is composed of serhingues actuated by a stepper motor. 
The stepper motor is controlled using an Arduino.
