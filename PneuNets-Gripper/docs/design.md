Design
=======================

#### PneuNets Gripper

The gripper is composed of three pneumatic actuators.

##### 1 PneuNets Actuator

Very detailled description of the PneuNets actuators can be found at the Soft robotics Toolkit pages: https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneunets-bending-actuator. We followed their approach and used FreeCAD to design our own actuator.

We provide the FreeCAD project "pneunet.fcstd" in the directory [PneuNets-Gripper/modeling](https://github.com/SofaDefrost/Tutorials/tree/master/PneuNets-Gripper/modeling).

##### Mounting Mechanism
TODO: describe a bit the design and add images

For achieving the function of the three Pneuts, we have to look for robust mounting platform that makes sure the air flows to three pneuts besides holding them.

The Mounting Mechanism of the Pneuts consists of five layer
