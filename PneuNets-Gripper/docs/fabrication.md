### Fabricating the mold to cast the PneuNets actuator
For fabrication of the mold we wanted to try the laser cutting system. The approach is a bit different from what we are used to when working with a 3D printer and we need to decompose the mold into a set of 0.5cm layers that are assembled.

To make these parts we used Inkscape. The draws are then sent to the laser cutting machine operating on Acrylic sheet of 0.5cm height. Given the heigh of acrylic we needs to assemble several identical shape to match the 2cm height of the PneuNet actuators. Compared to our cheap 3d printing devices the laser cutting machine operates really quickly to produce very good looking parts.

Now the drawback of having a laser cutting is that we have much more work to do to assemble all the parts. But after some assembling we finally got the following result which, because of the transparency of the Acrylic looks really cool.

### Mounting plateform
The mounting plateform is holding the three PneuNets actuators on a structure of triangular shape. The structure should also be used to hold the different pipes and air distribution system as well as a way to connect the gripper to a real 3-DOF robotic arm. <br><br><br>

### Pressure system and controller

The pressure system is composed of serhingues actuated by a stepper motor. 
The stepper motor is controlled using an Arduino. <br>
