Introduction 
=======================

This tutorial is about modelling, simulating and fabricating the PneuNets actuators. 

PneuNets (pneumatic networks) are a class of soft actuator originally developed by the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard. They are made up of a series of channels and chambers inside an elastomer. These channels inflate when pressurized, creating 
motion.

This tutorials is freely adapted from  https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneunets-bending-actuator, the big difference is on how to use the Sofa+Soft-Robot for modelling and simulation.
