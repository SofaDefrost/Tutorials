### Introduction

This tutorial is about modeling, simulating and fabricating an original soft gripper called __w-Gripper_ in Sofa-SR. `TODO: details about the gripper`. The simulation aspects is done using Sofa-SR. Sofa-SR is a modeling, simulation and control environment for Soft-Robotics using Sofa a real-time simulation framework for rigid and deformable mechanics. Sofa-SR is available from https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/

This tutorials is strongly inspired from https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneunets-bending-actuator, the biggest difference is on how to use the Sofa+Soft-Robot for modeling and simulation and control. 

#### Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial you need a working version of Sofa. We provide a Linux disk image with a pre-compiled version of Sofa with all the material for this tutorials. 

Otherwise you need to get sofa & its soft-robotic toolkit plugin:
- Sofa (from http://www.sofa-framework.org)
- Soft-Robotic plugin (from https://project.inria.fr/softrobot/)
